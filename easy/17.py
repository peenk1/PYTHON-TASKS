# Practice Problem: Create a new list from two given lists such that the new list contains odd numbers from the first list and even numbers from the second list.


list1 = [10, 20, 25, 30, 35]
list2 = [40, 45, 60, 75, 90]

list3 = []

for i in list1:
    if i % 2 != 0:
        list3.append(i)

for i in list2:
    if i % 2 == 0:
        list3.append(i)

print(list3)
